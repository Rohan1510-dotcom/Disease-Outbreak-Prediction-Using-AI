# 🦠 Disease Outbreak Prediction Using AI

Predicting disease outbreaks using machine learning and time series analysis to aid early detection and public health response.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to leverage AI and data science to predict the outbreak of diseases based on historical health, environmental, and demographic data. Early and accurate forecasting can help authorities allocate resources, issue timely alerts, and control the spread of diseases effectively.

## 🚀 Objectives

- Predict the likelihood and intensity of disease outbreaks.
- Analyze temporal trends using time series data.
- Apply classification and regression models for outbreak prediction.
- Visualize predictions and patterns for better understanding.

## 📊 Technologies & Tools Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas`, `numpy` (data preprocessing)
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` (visualizations)
  - `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm` (ML models)
  - `statsmodels`, `prophet` (time series analysis)
- **Other Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook / Pycharm
  - Git & GitHub
  - Streamlit (for optional web dashboard)

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle: Disease Outbreak Data, World Health Organization (WHO) - Global Health Observatory, India Open Government Data Platform
- **Contents**: Date, Location, Disease Name, Number of Cases, Deaths, Weather Conditions, Population, etc.
- **Preprocessing**: Missing values handling, normalization, encoding categorical variables, time indexing.

## 🧠 Models Implemented

- Time Series Forecasting:
  - ARIMA
  - Facebook Prophet
- Machine Learning Models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - XGBoost
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall
  - RMSE, MAE for regression
  - AUC-ROC for classification

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

- Heatmaps of outbreaks by region
- Time series plots of disease trends
- Confusion matrix for classification models
- Forecast charts (actual vs predicted)

## 🧪 Results

- ARIMA model had lowest RMSE on dengue outbreak data.
- XGBoost achieved 85% accuracy in predicting weekly outbreaks.
- Prophet model showed strong trend and seasonality correlation.
